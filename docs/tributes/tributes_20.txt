Ocean,
I thought I was gonna get 3 more years with you. I wish I could've packed those future years of friendship into the months we had, but I didn't know. I hope you're at peace. Know you are loved, and your kindness and energy while you were here has inspired so many people, even though you are gone.
Love, Isaac
