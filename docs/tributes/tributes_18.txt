Ocean, you were a beautiful soul. Our conversations were great. Your sense of humor was very funny and unique. But the thing that I really notices the most about you was your smile. It was contagious and beautiful. I miss your smile. And your laugh. I'll tell my friends and family about you, Ocean. You won't be forgotten.
